   <h2>Description</h2>
   
        <p>Fresh, Asian-inspired salmon fillets with a crispy skin and an orange, ginger, and honey glaze. Unlike most similar recipes, 
       this one is made without soy sauce and with totally fresh ingredients. The result is a bright, fresh fish with great taste 
       and texture. The fresh ingredients are the star here: Don't substitute with dried, powdered, or frozen ingredients! I served 
       on top of rice and steamed broccoli garnished with green onions.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
                <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1.2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>4 skin-on salmon fillets</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Combine orange juice, honey, vinegar, olive oil, garlic, ginger, sesame seeds, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Add salmon. Seal and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Place a large cast iron skillet in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Carefully remove skillet from oven when it just barely starts to smoke. Add vegetable oil and place salmon fillets, skin-side down, in the skillet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the hot oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, or to your desired doneness, 5 to 9 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
